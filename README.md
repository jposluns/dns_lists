# Comprehensive DNS Allowlist for Strict Ad Blocking

This repository provides a curated **DNS allowlist** (whitelist) designed to make the strictest and most comprehensive DNS blocklists usable in home environments without breaking legitimate services.

It is optimised for [AdGuard DNS](https://adguard-dns.io) but can be used with [AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome), [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/), or similar DNS-filtering platforms with only minor format adjustments.

## üß≠ Purpose

Aggressive DNS blocklists can improve privacy and reduce telemetry, but they often block essential functionality such as software activation, app store updates, payment processing, and authentication.

This project provides a **safe-use allowlist** that restores critical functionality for legitimate services while keeping ad, telemetry, and tracking domains blocked.

It allows you to run **maximum-strength blocking** while maintaining (mostly) seamless access to trusted ecosystems including:

- **Apple** ‚Äì iCloud, iTunes, App Store, Apple Pay, iMessage, activation, certificate validation  
- **Microsoft** ‚Äì Windows Update, Office 365, Xbox Live, Outlook, Teams, Edge, activation  
- **Google / Android** ‚Äì Play Store, push notifications, Gmail, Chrome Sync, Android backup, fonts, analytics APIs required for app operation  
- **Payment and Financial Gateways** ‚Äì PayPal, Stripe, Adyen, Square, Moneris, Plaid, Google Pay, Apple Pay, Interac  
- **Cloud and CDN Services** ‚Äì Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly, Amazon AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Firebase, CloudFront  
- **Security and Threat Intel Vendors** ‚Äì Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, Fortinet, Sophos, Mimecast, Proofpoint, ESET, Trend Micro, Cisco Talos  
- **Vendors and Hardware Ecosystems** ‚Äì ASUS (Armoury Crate, MyASUS, ROG), Gigabyte, Synology, UniFi (Ubiquiti), NVIDIA, Adobe Creative Cloud, LinkedIn CDN  
- **Gaming and Entertainment** ‚Äì Steam, Epic Games, Battle.net, Elder Scrolls Online, Ubisoft, Square Enix, ArenaNet, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, Discord, Zoom, Prime Video  
- **Email and Collaboration** ‚Äì Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Slack, Mimecast, Zoom, Okta SSO  
- **Time and NTP Services** ‚Äì Apple, Google, Microsoft, Cloudflare, pool.ntp.org  
- **Trusted Public DNS Resolvers** ‚Äì 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare), 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS), OpenDNS Umbrella, Quad9  
- **Other Critical Infrastructure** ‚Äì Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL/OCSP), telemetry for endpoint security, legitimate firmware and driver updates

## üß™ Testing

After applying filters:
- Confirm that essential services (e.g., Apple Pay, Microsoft Updates, Gmail, Steam) function normally.
- Validate blocking behaviour with:
  - [dnsleaktest.com](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/)
  - [AdGuard Test Page](https://adguard.com/test.html)
  - [whoer.net](https://whoer.net/)
